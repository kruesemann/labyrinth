# Gameplay

## Player

* the player has a certain luminosity
    * enemies take luminosity from the player
    * if the luminosity reaches zero the player dies
    * star fragments and beacons replenish luminosity to a maximum value
    * special events or places can increase maximum luminosity
    * what happens when maximum luminosity is reached? can the player still collect star fragments?
    * it has to be very clear to the player when maximum luminosity is reached

* second use for transformation dances
